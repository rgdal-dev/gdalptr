# gdalptr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gdalptr is to learn about raw pointer handling and interface building from [radbc](https://github.com/paleolimbot/radbc/). 


## Example that doesn't work

This is a basic example doesnt work: 

```{r example}
library(gdalptr)
dsn <- system.file("extdata/volcano_gcp.tif", package = "gdalptr", mustWork  = TRUE)
xptr <- GDALOpen(dsn)
GDALGetInfo(xptr)  ## this should tell us the raster count (1)
```
